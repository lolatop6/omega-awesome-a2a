# Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) Framework for Enterprise A2A Systems

## Resource Overview
**Title:** Towards Effective GenAI Multi-Agent Collaboration: Design and Evaluation for Enterprise Applications
**Focus Area:** Multi-agent collaboration and communication optimization
**Domain:** Enterprise Applications

## Original Analysis
The MAC Framework represents a breakthrough in A2A systems by introducing a dual-mode collaboration architecture that achieves unprecedented 90% success rates in enterprise scenarios. Its innovative payload referencing mechanism demonstrates significant performance improvements in code-intensive tasks (23% improvement) while reducing communication overhead by 27%. The framework's success in complex domains like Software Development, where it outperforms single-agent approaches by up to 70%, establishes a new benchmark for scalable multi-agent collaboration in practical applications.

## Technical Implementation
```python
class MACFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        self.coordination_mode = True
        self.payload_store = {}
        self.specialist_agents = []
        
    def payload_reference(self, content):
        """
        Optimized payload sharing mechanism for large content blocks
        """
        ref_id = hash(content)
        self.payload_store[ref_id] = content
        return ref_id
    
    def coordinate_agents(self, task):
        """
        Main coordination protocol for multi-agent collaboration
        """
        # Task distribution
        subtasks = self.decompose_task(task)
        specialist_assignments = {}
        
        for subtask in subtasks:
            specialist = self.select_specialist(subtask)
            if len(subtask['content']) > 1000:
                # Use payload referencing for large content
                ref_id = self.payload_reference(subtask['content'])
                subtask['content'] = f"ref:{ref_id}"
            specialist_assignments[specialist] = subtask
            
        return self.aggregate_results(specialist_assignments)
